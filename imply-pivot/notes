BOOLEAN should be ordinal
if a dimension is ordinal then bar chart is the best

In case of switch to bar chart it should auto order by the dimension iff the dimension is ordinal

Single measure drives pinboard

Picking a non additive measure in a visualization that needs an additive measure (like Treemap) will cause the vis to go to the fallback screen

Need to change logic in time series resizing to add maxHeight to chart


Roadmap:
- Custom time split granularity


ToDos:
- BUG: try to pin time dimension
- Add min granularity to dataSource
- Make PivotConfig object
- Add tracking hooks
- Colors should not store limit


Questions:
- If filtering on colors=(limit 5 sorted on Revenue) filter menu is sorted on count, what to do?
  Suggestion: If filter menu has colors it is sorted by colors measure.
